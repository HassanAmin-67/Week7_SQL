1. Characterizing the Audio Aura

To get a sense of a listener’s musical vibe from their top 100 streamed songs in 2018, we look at the average energy, danceability, and valence of those tracks:
Energy tells us how intense and lively the music is. If the average energy is high, it means the listener likely enjoys more energetic and upbeat tunes.
Danceability indicates how good a song is for dancing. A high average here suggests the listener prefers tracks that are great for hitting the dance floor.
Valence measures the overall mood of the music. A high average valence means the listener leans towards happier and more positive songs.

2. Limitations and Improvements

There are a few things to keep in mind with this method:
Lack of Context: Averaging these values might not capture the full picture. For instance, if a few songs with extreme values are included, they could skew the results.
Data Homogeneity: If the top 100 songs are from a specific genre or time period, this might not fully represent the listener’s tastes across different genres or times.

To get a more accurate picture of the listener’s preferences:
Include More Features: Adding details like tempo, genre, or the time of year the songs were released could give a richer view of musical taste.
Weighted Averages: Using weighted averages based on how often songs are played or the time they’re from might better reflect the listener’s overall habits.
